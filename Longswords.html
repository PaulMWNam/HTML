  <h2>The Longsword</h2>
  <p>The longsword is a weapon of a ambigious nature, with a storied history. Used to describe a wide variety of different swords, longswords are a two handed weapon historically used in war, dueling and entertainment. They typically consist of four main parts.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Pommel: A counterweight found on one end of the weapon, usually round or pear-shaped in nature. It provides the lever action that a longsword uses to provide strong, powerful cuts.</li>
    <li>The Grip: The section where a swordsman will typically hold his weapon. The grip is typically 9-11 inches long to allow enough room for a two handed grip. The offhand will usually hold the weapon near the bottom of the grip or on the pommel directly.</li>
    <li>The Quillon: Often seen as two protrusions that extend horizontally from the base of the blade. The quillons serve to protect the users hands during a duel.</li>
    <li>The Blade: The "weapon" portion of the longsword, used for fighting one's opponent. They come in a wide variety of lengths ranging from 90 to 110 cm in length and are typically made up of the strong (the wider base) and weak (the tapered end).</li>
    </ul>

    <div id="Differences">
      <p>The German and Italian schools of fencing share a surprisingly large amount of overlap between the different positions and ways to hold a sword. Some of their techniques also share many similarities but there are a few interesting differences between the two schools.</p>
